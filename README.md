# Outcomes Insights, Inc. Draft Common Data Model

A common data model (CDM) defines a set of standard locations in which information of specific types should be stored.  As such, it describes the end result of an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process for an arbitrary source (or raw) dataset.  CDM specifications can be created with a variety of goals for the resulting data model.  The goals of this CDM are twofold:

1. To minimize vocabulary mapping and restructuring in order to improve CDM adoption and to separate the data model from the vocabulary model
1. To capture the provenance of the data in order to enhance the reproducibility of studies that use the CDM

While we are inspired by CDMs such as OMOP, we find that the OMOP model requires a substantial mapping of vocabularies and domains that is intended to allow queries to operate on data from any source.  While this is a potentially powerful design goal, it results in a very complicated ETL process that varies across ETL practitioners.  It creates a steep learning curve for understanding and using novel vocabularies required to navigate the data.  And it ignores a substantial literature that uses validated algorithms based on the vocabularies in the source data, reducing transparency and reproducibility.

Therefore, as part of the data model, we do not want to incorporate information about whether a particular code represents a condition, measurement, observation, or drug exposure.  Instead, we prefer to retain data using their native vocabularies (e.g., ICD-9, HCPCS, CPT, etc.) so that we can focus on when, and in what context, the ideas represented by the codes were reported.  Hence, the fundamental premise of our CDM is that moving the data into a CDM should be separated from mapping the data to clinical research variables.

The rationale for separating these functions is that vocabulary mappings are prone to refinement and they can obscure the connection back to the source data ("provenance").  Also, mappings are not universally available (e.g., procedure vocabularies).  Furthermore, to the extent that there are potential efficiencies to expressing queries in a common vocabulary (e.g., SNOMED), this does not require that every code in the data be remapped **during the ETL process**.  Generalized queries only require a mapping from the common vocabulary (e.g., SNOMED) to the codes available in the dataset at hand, which can readily be done "on the fly."

Perhaps the simplest way to explain the philosophy of our CDM is that, if an algorithm involves a specific code, we should know the CDM table in which to look for that code regardless of the structure of the original (raw) data.  Then we should be able to leverage our library of existing algorithms and vocabulary tools to operate on the data and create all of the variables for our study datasets.  The ultimate goal is **not to have to do any ETL at all**, and to operate against the raw data directly.  However, for the time being, we are focused on building a simple CDM that involves minimal ETL, coupled with a framework for creating, storing, sharing, and using algorithms that operate on a CDM.

To this end, we have developed an open-source language, [ConceptQL](https://github.com/outcomesinsights/conceptql), that enables us to create, store, share, and use algorithms that are designed to work on electronic health information.  Our project, [Jigsaw](http://www.jigsawanalytics.com) leverages ConceptQL to create a mechanism for leveraging algorithms and vocabularies separately from the CDM.

## clinical_codes

- Instead of having separate condition and procedure tables, we'll include all codes from the following vocabularies:
  - ICD-9 (Proc and CM)
  - ICD-10 (Proc and CM)
  - SNOMED
  - Medcode (CPRD)
  - HCPCS/CPT
- The OMOP specification for procedure and condition tables are quite similar.  Having separate tables follows with OMOP's philosophy of classifying each concept into a specific domain.  The PCORnet CDM has two condition tables (one for results of diagnostic processes and one for condition lists), and a procedure table.  Again, these are all very similar in structure.  Since domains are semantic classifications, and since all of the tables are so similar, there is no philosophical or technical reason why we can't combine conditions and procedures into the same table.  After all, all of the above-listed vocabularies include multiple domains.
- For each code we find in the source data, we will create a new row in this table.  The code from the source data will be matched against OMOP's concept table and we will save the concept_id in this table, rather than the raw code.

## details

- Additional information - measurements, observations, status, and specifications
- Text-based vocabularies should be mapped to LOINC, if possible (e.g., laboratory data indexed by text names for the lab results)
- Other vocabularies should be included in their original system (e.g., SEER variables)
  - This could be implemented by making variable names a vocabulary in themselves
- May need to add variables for "normal range", or consider a separate table for additional laboratory details

## exposures

- To capture drug and device data
- Drugs and devices captured in the clinical_codes table should remain in the clinical_codes table.
- Could include devices if they are reported separately from procedures.  Note that these may be text entries and may have mis-spellings (e.g., MedAssets and other text-based data sources).  Mapping to a vocabulary may or may not be possible.
- Vocabularies
  - NDC
  - RxNorm

## Miscellaneous details and questions

- What about modifiers - tend to be for laterality (left/right) or multiple physicians and maybe part of ETL
- Additional physician information -- do we need something on "care site"?
- Need to define types in the data
- Is there a way to connect data elements with information periods (i.e., when is prescription data available?)  Does this matter?
- Do we need to pull some fields out of clinical_codes and put them into lines such as position?
