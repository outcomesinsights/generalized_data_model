# Outcomes Insights, Inc. Draft Data Model

We define a data model as a set of standard tables in which information of specific types should be stored combined with the relationships among the tables.  It defines the end result of an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process for an arbitrary source (or raw) dataset.  The goals of our data model are five-fold:

1. To simplify the location of the most important information for creating analysis data sets and studies
1. To store virtually all data using its **source** vocabulary
1. To capture hierarchical relationships among data elements within a relational data structure
1. To retain the provenance of the original data in order to enhance the reproducibility of studies 
1. To facilitate a straightforward, subsequent ETL process to other data models, including OMOP and PCORnet

The focus of our data model is on the information in the source vocabulary (i.e., the vocabularies used in the original data).  This approach will allow us to utilize the substantial literature of validated algorithms based on the the source data vocabularies, enhancing transparency and reproducibility.  Therefore, within the data model, we do not separate clinical events into conditions, procedures, measurements, observations, or drug exposures.  They are all simply clinical events, with codes to identify them.  We store data using their original vocabularies (e.g., ICD-9, HCPCS, CPT, etc.) to retain the original expression of the underlying clinical information.  We use "detail" tables to capture additional information that is specific to a subset of data elements, but which is not always used (e.g., days supplied for drugs, quantities for procedures, etc.).

In particular, we avoid translating clinical codes from one vocabulary to another without strong evidence that such a process results in a simpler and/or clearer representation of the underlying information.  This is because these relationships are prone to continuous refinement, and they are not available for all vocabularies (e.g., procedure vocabularies).  Furthermore, the potential efficiencies from expressing queries using a common vocabulary (e.g., SNOMED) do not require that every code in the data be translated **during the ETL process**.  Queries that work across datasets with different source vocabularies can readily be done "on the fly."  The excellent vocabulary mappings provided by the Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) community make such a process easy to implement. 

We have the idea of "Contexts" and "Collections" that work across both administrative claims data and electronic medical records.  This avoids the need to try and construct "visits" from claims data which often leads to inaccuracy, loss of information, and complicated ETL processing.  In our model, the "Context" captures both the provenance of the data (where was this data element in the soruce file) as well as the associations among related data elements.  These associations generally involve procedures and associated diagnoses, procedure modifiers, sequences of prescription records, and laboratory measures captured at the same time.

The strength of our approach is that, if an algorithm involves a specific code, we will know exactly where to find that code regardless of the structure of the original (raw) data.  This allows us to use vocabulary tools and a broad library of existing algorithms to operate on the data and create all of the variables for our study datasets.  To this end, we have developed an open-source language, [ConceptQL](https://github.com/outcomesinsights/conceptql_spec), that enables us to create, store, share, and use algorithms that are designed to work on electronic health information.  Our project, [Jigsaw](http://www.jigsaw.io) leverages ConceptQL to define an dapply algorithms against data in our data model to build study datasets.  (And Jigsaw is designed so that algorithms also work across data **models**.)

Below is the current version of the schema for the OI Data Model.  We gratefully acknowledge the influence of the open-source OHDSI common data model [specifications](http://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation:cdm) on our thinking in creating our data model.  In addition, we acknowledge the influence of both PCORnet and i2b2 on our approach, although most of our CDM was designed prior to fully reviewing these data models.  At the moment, all references to the concepts table refer to the OMOP version 5 vocabulary [table](http://www.ohdsi.org/web/athena/) maintained by OHDSI.

## clinical_codes

- Stores clinical codes from all types of records including procedures and diagnoses.
  - ICD-9 (Proc and CM)
  - ICD-10 (Proc and CM)
  - SNOMED
  - Medcode (CPRD)
  - HCPCS/CPT
- Ignores semantic distinctions about the type of information represented within a vocabulary because most vocabularies contain information from more than one domain
- One record generated for each individual code in the raw data
- Consider using this as fact table in dimensional schema (if used)
- Consider moving common fields from the exposures and details tables to this table, and using those tables to store only additional information specific to those domains

## details

- Additional information - measurements, observations, status, and specifications
- Text-based vocabularies should be mapped to LOINC, if possible (e.g., laboratory data indexed by text names for the lab results)
- Other vocabularies should be included in their original system (e.g., SEER variables)
  - This could be implemented by making variable names a vocabulary in themselves
- May need to add variables for "normal range", or consider a separate table for additional laboratory details

## exposures

- To capture drug and device data
- Drugs and device records recorded in the clinical_codes table should remain in the clinical_codes table (e.g., HCPCS drug codes)
- Could include devices if they are reported separately from their associated procedures.  Note that these may be text entries and may have mis-spellings.  Mapping to a vocabulary may or may not be possible.
- Example vocabularies
  - NDC
  - RxNorm
  - Prodcodes (CPRD)

## costs

- To capture costs (charges, paid amounts, and/or costs) for each provided service
- All costs are linked to a claim and could also be linked to a line, to align with the original data
- Do we need a column to indicate payer if there is more than 1 row associated with a cost record?
- Should revenue codes be in clinical_codes table?  Same with DRG and APC codes?

## deaths

- Capture mortality information including date and cause(s) of death
- Commonly populated from beneficiary or similar administrative data associated with the medical record
- Might need to check discharge status as part of ETL process to fill this out completely
- Use of *claim_id* and *line_id* is not necessary since deaths are in the clinical_codes table if they are specific diagnosis codes from an encounter
- Should this just be in the clinical_codes table?

| column                | type   | description                                                                                           |

## information_periods

- Captures periods for which information in each table is relevant
- Could include enrollment types (e.g., Part A, Part B, HMO) or just "observable" (as with up-to-standard data in CPRD)
- One row per person per enrollment type per table

## admission_details

- Captures details about admissions and emergency department encounters that don't go in the clinical_codes, lines, or claims tables
- One row per admission
- Should handle this in the same way as "extra" information from exposures table and details table if some of their information is moved into clinical_codes
- Should we add "stay_type" to capture "observation stays" that are in the hospital but counted as outpatient facility visits?
